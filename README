go-keyless: a client for https://github.com/cloudflare/keyless

My goal at the moment is just to implement the functionality required for
'testclient' to run.  Injecting into crypto/tls is a larger, different project.

To play with:

Download and build keyless.  Start the keyless demo server

keyless$ make run PORT=2047

Run the test client. You'll need to point it at the test certificates that come
with keyless. At the moment, it just tries to send a ping and dump the
response.  However, it's tls.Dial() is failing with EOF.  TLS config stuff is
probably broken.

testclient$ go run main.go -server=localhost -port=2047 \
    -client-cert=$KEYLESS/testing/client-cert/ecdsa/ecdsa-client.pem  \
    -client-key=$KEYLESS/testing/client-cert/ecdsa/ecdsa-client-key.pem \
    -ca-file=$KEYLESS/testing/CAs/testca-keyserver.pem

I'm not a fan of the current API, but it matches with the C one kind-of.
