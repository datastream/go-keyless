go-keyless: a client for https://github.com/cloudflare/keyless

My goal at the moment is just to implement the functionality required for
'testclient' to run.  Injecting into crypto/tls is a larger, different project.

To play with:

Download and build keyless.  Currently, Go can't talk to a keyless server
because crypto/tls doesn't support ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384 and
ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384, the only two ciphers keyless accepts.  If you want
to play, you need to patch your local keyless to include support for more
ciphers.  The easiest two to change to are ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256 and
ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256.  (256 -> 128, 384 -> 256).

Start the keyless demo server

keyless$ make run PORT=2047

Run the test client. You'll need to point it at the test certificates that come
with keyless. At the moment, it just tries to send a ping and dump the
response.

testclient$ go run main.go -server=localhost -port=2047 \
    -client-cert=$KEYLESS/testing/client-cert/ecdsa/ecdsa-client.pem  \
    -client-key=$KEYLESS/testing/client-cert/ecdsa/ecdsa-client-key.pem \
    -ca-file=$KEYLESS/testing/CAs/testca-keyserver.pem

I'm not a fan of the current API, but it matches with the C one kind-of.
